                  Hi, I’m Chris, I’m a 3rd year studying Maths and Physics, I’ve been doing Taekwondo for 11 years now and am a 2nd degree black belt. We're open to all styles of Taekwondo at Warwick, ITF and WTF, and that gives us an incredible array of skills to learn from each other. Training is suitable for anyone whether you want to earn new belts, win medals at competitions or learn self defence and keep fit, our training is very broad and includes traditional patterns, competitive sparring and practical defence. The martial art has a lot to offer and the club even more from its welcoming members and 'engaging' socials; please get in touch if there's anything else you'd like to know about the club, exec or instructor, and feel free to come along to any of our training sessions.

                Hi, I’m Alex, a third year Accounting and Finance student and I’m the treasurer. I took up taekwondo when I first joined Warwick after seeing it at the Olympics and am so glad that I did. Through the club I’ve learnt new skills, improved my fitness, got involved in national competitions and met some awesome people. As treasurer it’s my job to look after the finances. This involves collecting training fees and making sure that money is always spent in the interest of the club and its’ members. This club is perfect for people of any ability as everyone can learn something new each week and do so in a great atmosphere.

                Hi, I’m Sian, a 3rd year undergraduate studying Biochemistry. I’m currently a 1st degree black belt, so Taekwondo has been a big part of my life for a while now, and hopefully it’ll stay that way! One of the best things I did when I came to Warwick was join the club – it enriches the Uni experience in such an all-rounded way. It helped me to of course keep training, but also to go to so many fabulous socials, make loads of friends, and even to travel to incredible places! It really immerses you in the student culture. As well as this, Warwick Taekwondo has given me the opportunity to push myself to new limits – I’ve competed more than I ever have before and I’m fitter than I’ve ever been. Whether you’re like me and want to challenge yourself, or you’re a complete beginner, we’re a friendly bunch and we’d love to have you as part of our team!

                Hey! We are Oliver (a 3rd year Discrete Maths student) and Ryan (a 3rd year Politics and International Studies student) and we're complete Taekwondo beginners, having started in January! Since then we have graded to yellow tags and attended our first competition at the British Student Nationals. When we joined, we immediately felt part of the club, and want to extend that welcome to all future members. We're going to get everyone socialising away from training, by arranging meals, nights outs and paint balling excursions. We would thoroughly recommend anyone of any ability to join this vibrant and fun club.

                Hi I'm Leigh and I'm a second year student studying maths. Taekwondo has been such an important part of my life for 10 years now and I am currently a third dan black belt. Having loved my Taekwondo club at home I was really worried that I would have to give up on the sport upon going to uni but I needn't have been concerned - when I arrived I was instantly welcomed into the group, not only as a club member but as a friend. After a year of being Social Sec, I've now stepped up to being your club Captain. Having been British Ladies Black Belt Student Champion for two years running, it's my job to get you all competing to a high standard, whether you're in it to win it or just love the adrenalin burst. So if you just love the sport, want to keep fit and try something new or are just interested in making new friends then Warwick Taekwondo is definitely the sport for you!

                  Hi, I'm Jess and I'm in my second year studying French and History. Before I came to Warwick I had no experience in any form of martial arts, but now I'm a yellow belt and a gold medal winner and I can't imagine my life without Taekwondo. The club has so much to offer - from learning new skills, entering competitions and just bettering your own fitness, it has also been an amazing opportunity socially and abated any fears I had about struggling to make new friends when I came to university. As this year's charity officer I am looking forward to organising the club's charity events, which in the past have included a pub quiz and a sponsored sparathon and have proven to be great successes both in the amount of money raised and the amount of fun had! So whether you're a seasoned student of Taekwondo or a complete beginner like I was, come along to training and see where Warwick Taekwondo will take you.

It has been great for my fitness as well has helping to create new friends which is often hard when starting a new hobby in an unfamiliar place. I am your kit sec for this year, which means I will be offering you the chance to buy everything you need to start your training as well as branded university taekwondo kit and providing all the gear we need for training from belts to pads. I am very approachable so feel free to ask me any questions.

                Hi, my name’s Sophie and I’m a 4th year engineer. Having started as a complete novice in freshers, I have somehow managed to progress into a Gold medal winning blue belt. Taekwondo rapidly became my biggest passion and I cannot imagine my life without it! The club is incredibly friendly and welcome to anyone – whether you’re new or at the top of your game. The large variation in class means that no matter whether you want to learn self-defence, participate in competitions, keep fit or just earn belts, there’s a place for you! We’re open to all styles of taekwondo, having sessions for both ITF and WTF style taekwondo as well as a variety of seminars and competitions throughout the year. With a large social calendar, the club is a place for cementing friendships and having fun as well as doing a martial art. There’s so much this martial art has to offer! If you have any questions about anything, don’t hesitate to ask and come along to any of our sessions!

                Hi, I’m Tom and I’m a 2nd year studying Engineering. I have been training in Taekwondo for over 7 years and I am a 2nd Degree black belt. Taekwondo is a huge part of my life and has given me the ability to do things I never expected I would, including competing at national level tournaments, overcome challenging situations and generally be more confident. I would recommend that anyone who thinks about trying out a martial art come to Taekwondo, as it develops fitness, flexibility and self-control. As treasurer, I am responsible for the club’s finances. This consists of collecting training fees and ensuring that everything that we do in the club is in the best interests of the members and the club as a whole. The club is a fantastic way to get fit, gain new experiences and meet fantastic people outside of your course. I hope to see you at the next training session!

                Hey, I’m Kaja, a third year undergraduate in Maths and Physics. Before joining Taekwon-do at the beginning of my second year at Warwick, I would never have imagined that this club would become such an integral part of my university life! From a grand level of absolute zero knowledge, I have now competed in the British Student Taekwondo nationals, won my first ever medals, done charity fights with the club, met some genuinely incredible people, travelled to new places... the whole lot! My secretary role has also helped me begin to learn about the principles of Taekwon-do nationally within different clubs, and realise what it is that makes us so different from the others: it’s that perseverance, friendliness and staying true to being a student club that makes us special. So if you’re worried that you might be too late in your university career to join a new club, or perhaps you’re a first-year who is unsure which sport to join: fear not. Never too late. Join us. We have plenty of cookies. And nerds.

When we’re not busy debating whose name should go first in self-descriptive passages we’re organising the club’s social gatherings; which range from meals to Wednesday night Pop! to the big one itself - TKD Tour. As a 3rd Dan black belt and total beginner respectively we entered the club from different perspectives but we both felt welcomed with open arms by this wonderful society, which we wholeheartedly recommend to absolutely anyone!

                Hi, I'm a third year computer scientist I will be your publicity officer this year. This involves keeping the website update, making new videos and making sure we get into the boar newspaper. I would like to help grow the club as much as possible. I have been doing Tae Kwon Do for the past 4-5 years. It has completely changed my life, making me more confident in everything I do. Tae Kwon Do is a great martial art for any one to start (at Warwick) because it helps get you fit, meet some really great people and go on tour!!! Infact because of Tae Kwon Do I now have a Guiness world record (Not as impressive as you're thinking ).

I have competed in several top international tournaments around the world and have represented Great Britain. I had only trained in WTF until I joined university, but since, I’ve enjoyed introducing ITF elements into my repertoire. Any nerves that I’d had were instantly dispelled by the welcoming nature of the existing members. As Captain, I hope to pass on as much wisdom as possible and motivate you, helping you to reach your goals no matter how large or small. Whether it is to prepare for that moment you step in the ring, an incredible adrenaline rush or simply to maintain a good level of fitness, everyone has their own reasons. So no matter your past experience of Taekwondo, head down to one of our sessions to try out this dynamic sport.

                Hello! Im Tom, a second year History student and your Charity and Community Officer for this year. It's my job to sort out all of the charitable activities that Warwick Taekwondo will be doing this year, along with arranging donations to the charity that we are sponsoring (which is yet to be decided!). These events could ranger from pub quizzes to poker nights, but don't hesitate to talk to me if you think you have a great idea. I started Warwick Taekwondo completely new to the martial art, and though I had done Karate for four years before, I found it extremely easy to shift styles because the club is so accommodating. Taekwondo has become such a large part of my university life, and I've made so many new friends at the club that (cliché alert) I seriously couldn't imagine my life without it. If you ever need me, just talk to the guy who looks like Ed Sheeran. Cheers!

Hey, I’m Danielle and I’m a 2nd year Data Science student who will be your Kit Sec for this year, which means I’ll be sorting out all the equipment and merchandise you could possibly need! I joined Warwick Tae Kwon-Do at the start of last year with no previous martial arts experience at all, but by the end of the year I’d managed to become a green belt and won a few gold medals along the way too, which just goes to show how much I have enjoyed being a part of the club! I encourage you to join no matter what level you are as I’m positive that you’ll find yourself as an integrated member of our club in no time at all. If you have any questions, feel free to ask - we may train to kick and punch properly but we’re not that scary, promise!
